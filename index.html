					Instructions
				</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Peel off and discard banana skin. Place banana in a microwave-safe bowl and use a fork to mash bananas until smooth,
						liquid-like form.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add 1 cup of oatmeal. Stir to mix. Check the consistency of the mixture. If it is similar to liquid or custard, add more
						oatmeal. The end result should be 95% oatmeal and the rest banana.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cover the bowl with a lid and place in the microwave for 2 minutes. Check to see if the bread has become a solid form.
						If not, microwave for another minute.
					</li>
